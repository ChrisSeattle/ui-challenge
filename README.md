## Overview
We picked up a project this morning and we want to get as much of it done before 2pm. We want to design with a a mobile-first approach and must be responsive when the screen size changes. The client wants a breakpoint of 960 pixels. The mobile view has a width of 480 pixels. We are given a comp for both the mobile and wide view, the width of the containers between the 960-pixel breakpoint and 480 pixels can (and probably should!) utilize the entire screen width.
